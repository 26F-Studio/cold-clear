# The names of most keys are unsurprising, but if you can't guess one you can
# find a list of the key names here:

# Examples of key names that aren't so obvious: LShift, RControl, Key1, Numpad0

# If this file can't be loaded, the default controls will be used and an error
# message will be printed to the console, which you can see by running this
# program from a shell.
